							<h1>Your wallet. 
Without the wallet.</h1>

							Apple Pay
							<p>Paying in stores or within apps has never been easier. Gone are the days of searching for your wallet. The wasted moments finding the right card. Now payments happen with a single touch.</p>

							<p>Apple Pay will change how you make purchases with breakthrough contactless payment technology and unique security features built right into the devices you have with you every day. So you can use your iPhone, Apple Watch, or iPad to pay in a simple, secure, and private way.</p>

						

					

				

			

		

		
			
				<h2>An easier way to pay in stores.</h2>

				
				
					
						<h3>iPhone 6</h3>

						<p>One touch to pay with Touch ID. Now paying in stores happens in one natural motion — there’s no need to open an app or even wake your display thanks to the innovative Near Field Communication antenna in iPhone 6. To pay, just hold your iPhone near the contactless reader with your finger on Touch ID. You don’t even have to look at the screen to know your payment information was successfully sent. A subtle vibration and beep let you know.</p>

						<p>
							<a shape="rect" href="http://images.apple.com/media/us/apple-pay/2014/d0e4d8b6-778c-46b2-b830-096087c9f2aa/feature/normal/applepay-normal-cc-us-20141016_r848-9dwc.mov">Watch the demo</a>
						</p>

					

				

				
			

			
				
					
						
							<h3>Apple Watch</h3>

							<p>Double-click to pay and go. To pay with Apple Watch, just double?click the side button and hold the face of your Apple Watch near the contactless reader. A gentle pulse and tone confirm that your payment information was sent.</p>

							Coming Early 2015
						

					

					
				

			

		

		
			
				<h2>An easier way to pay within apps.</h2>

				
					
						<p>Convenient checkout. On iPhone 6, iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3, you can also use Apple Pay to pay with a single touch within apps. Checking out is as easy as selecting Apple Pay and placing your finger on Touch ID.</p>

				<h3>Setup is simple. </h3>

				
					
						<p>Passbook already stores your boarding passes, tickets, coupons, and more. Now it can store your credit and debit cards, too. To get started, you can add the credit or debit card from your iTunes account to Passbook by simply entering the card security code.</p>

					

					
						<p>To add a card on iPhone 6, iPad Air 2, or iPad mini 3, go into Settings, open Passbook &amp; Apple Pay, and select “Add Credit or Debit Card.” On iPhone, you can also just open Passbook, then swipe down and tap the plus sign. From there, use your iSight camera to enter the card information or type it in manually. This card will be your default payment card, but you can go to Passbook anytime to pay with a different card or select a new default in Settings.</p>

				<h2>More secure payments.</h2>

				
					
						<p>Every time you hand over your credit or debit card to pay, your card number and identity are visible. With Apple Pay, instead of using your actual credit and debit card numbers when you add your card, a unique Device Account Number is assigned, encrypted, and securely stored in the Secure Element, a dedicated chip in iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch. These numbers are never stored on Apple servers. And when you make a purchase, the Device Account Number, along with a transaction-specific dynamic security code, is used to process your payment. So your actual credit or debit card numbers are never shared by Apple with merchants or transmitted with payment.</p>

					

				

				
					
						
					

					
						<p>Protect your accounts.
Even if you lose your device.
If your iPhone or iPad is ever lost or stolen, you can use Find My iPhone to quickly put your device in Lost Mode to suspend Apple Pay, or you can wipe your device clean completely.</p>

					

				

			

		

		
			
				
					
						<h2>Keep your purchases private.</h2>

						<p>Apple doesn’t save your transaction information. With Apple Pay, your payments are private. Apple Pay doesn’t store the details of your transactions so they can’t be tied back to you. Your most recent purchases are kept in Passbook for your convenience, but that’s as far as it goes.</p>

						<p>Keep your cards in your wallet. Since you don’t have to show your credit or debit card, you never reveal your name, card number, or security code to the cashier when you pay in a store. This additional layer of privacy helps ensure that your information stays where it belongs. With you.</p>

					

				

				
			

		

		
			
				<h2>Accepted in great stores and apps. With more added every day.</h2>

				<p>
					Apple Pay lets you use iPhone 6 or Apple Watch to pay in hundreds of thousands of stores accepting contactless payments. You can also make purchases within participating apps on iPhone 6, iPad Air 2, and iPad mini 3. And more stores and apps are accepting Apple Pay every day.
