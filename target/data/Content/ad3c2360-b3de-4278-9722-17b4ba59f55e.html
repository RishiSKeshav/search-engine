				<p>With Personal Pickup, you can place your order on the Apple Online Store or the Apple Store app, then pick it up at any Apple Retail Store. We’ll even set up your new Apple product just the way you like — before you leave the store.
<a shape="rect" href="http://store.apple.com/us">Shop online now</a></p>

						<p>Order from the Apple Online Store or through the Apple Store app on your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch. Select “Pick up” during checkout and we’ll have your order waiting at the Apple Retail Store of your choice.1 <a shape="rect" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id375380948?mt=8">Download the Apple Store app</a></p>

						<p>You’ll receive an email when your product is ready — usually within an hour.2 Just come to the Apple Retail Store and let us know you’re here. We’ll bring out your items and answer any questions. We’ll even help get your new Apple product up and running with <a shape="rect" href="/retail/personalsetup/">Personal Setup</a> before you leave the store. And if you need to return an online order, bring it to an Apple Retail Store and we’ll take it from there.</p>

					<p>Personal Pickup is perfect for gift-giving, especially when your lucky recipient lives elsewhere. That’s because you can place your order, and someone else can pick it up. So whether you’re giving an iPod touch to your nephew across the country or a new Mac to your daughter in college, they can pick it up the same day you order it.3</p>

				<dl>	<dt>When can I pick up my items?</dt>
	<dd>
						<p>You’ll receive an email notifying you when your order is ready for pickup. During regular business hours, most items will be available at the Apple Retail Store within an hour.</p>

						<p>If your item is not available for immediate pickup, an estimated delivery date will tell you when to expect it. When it’s ready for pickup, we’ll send you an email. If you purchased multiple items, you can wait until all the items are ready for pickup or pick them up as they become available.</p>

					</dd>
	<dt>Can you notify me about my order via text message?</dt>
	<dd>
						<p>Yes. Simply add your mobile number during checkout to receive a text message when your items are ready for pickup.</p>

					</dd>
	<dt>What do I need to bring when I pick up my order?</dt>
	<dd>
						<p>You will need to bring a valid photo ID and the web order number, or the credit card used for payment.</p>

					</dd>
	<dt>Where do I go when I arrive?</dt>
	<dd>
						<p>When you get to the Apple Store, just let us know you’re here. We’ll bring out your items, answer any questions, and help you set up your products.</p>

					</dd>
	<dt>Can someone else pick up my order?</dt>
	<dd>
						<p>Yes — for all products except iPhone. If you designate someone else to pick up your order, they’ll need to bring the web order number and their valid photo ID.</p>

						<p>If you’ve ordered an iPhone with a new wireless account or a new line, it can only be picked up by the account holder — the person whose billing information is linked to the wireless account.</p>

						<p>If you’re upgrading or replacing an iPhone, it can be picked up by the account holder or by a person authorized by the account holder. Contact your wireless carrier to authorize people on the account.</p>

						<p>If your iPhone is unlocked, it can be picked up by the person who placed the order or the pickup contact on the order.</p>

					</dd>
	<dt>Can I change my iPhone order when I arrive to pick it up?</dt>
	<dd>
						<p>You can make some changes — such as color or storage capacity — to your Personal Pickup iPhone order when you get to the store. But you can’t replace your carrier-contracted iPhone with an unlocked iPhone.</p>

						<p>If you want to cancel your Personal Pickup order in the store, we’ll be happy to refund your purchase price.4</p>

					</dd>
	<dt>How do I return a product?</dt>
	<dd>
						<p>If you’re not completely satisfied with your purchase, you have two easy options. You can return an item directly to your local Apple Retail Store. If that’s not convenient, you can send it back to us. We’ll even cover the shipping. Visit the <a shape="rect" href="http://store.apple.com/us">Apple Online Store</a> or call 1?800?MY?APPLE. We’ll take care of everything else.</p>

					</dd>
	<dt>How do I view or change my order?</dt>
	<dd>
						<p>Use online <a shape="rect" href="https://secure.store.apple.com/us/order/list">Order Status</a> to view up-to-date information and make changes to your order. Have questions? Check online <a shape="rect" href="http://store.apple.com/us/help">help</a> for more information about changing, picking up, and returning your order.</p>

						<p>You can also reach our Customer Service team at 1?800?MY?APPLE, Monday through Friday from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m., or Saturday and Sunday from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Pacific time. Just have your order number ready.</p>
