				<h1>It’s music. Mastered.</h1>

				<p>iTunes lets you play your music on whichever device you’re using — your iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, PC, or Apple TV. Rock out on your way to work. Kick back and relax at home. Create playlists for your next party. Or let someone else be the DJ and listen to a curated or genre-specific iTunes Radio station — for free. With over 43 million songs to choose from, iTunes is sure to have something to fit your every mood.1 Or something to change it.</p>

				
			

		

		
			
				<h2>All your music is just a tap away.</h2>

				<p>The iTunes player on your desktop — and the Music app on your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch — keeps all your music in one place, so it’s there when you’re ready to listen. Instead of going through stacks of CDs or digital files, you can import them into iTunes and quickly browse your whole collection. Organize your library any way you want. Move it onto any of your devices. Create playlists and enjoy them whenever and wherever. Even have Genius make mixes of songs that go great together.</p>

				
					

					
						<ul>	<li>
								
								
									<h4>On iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.</h4>

									<p>Open the Music app and select artists, playlists, or songs.</p>

								

							</li>
	<li>
								
								
									<h4>On Mac and PC.</h4>

									<p>Open iTunes, go to your music library, and select artists, playlists, or songs.</p>

								

							</li>
	<li>
								
								
									<h4>On Apple TV.</h4>

									<p>Select Music from the home screen.</p>

</ul>

					
				
			

		

		
			
				

				
					<h2>iTunes Radio</h2>

					<p>iTunes Radio gives you free, streaming stations you’ll love from day one — like DJ-curated and genre-focused radio stations.2 Or easily create your own stations that evolve based on the music you play and download. And iTunes Radio includes First Plays, so you can listen to selected full albums before buying them.</p>

					<a shape="rect" href="/itunes/itunes-radio/">Learn more</a>
				

			

		

		
			
				
					<h2>Genius</h2>

					<p>Genius can search your library on your computer or iOS device3 to find songs that go great together, then organize them into genre-based mixes and playlists you’ll love. It’s an easy way to create a collection of music that matches your mood. When you’re ready for a change of pace, simply tap Genius Shuffle. Expand an album in your library on your Mac and see In the Store recommendations for songs you don’t own yet — but should.</p>

				

				
			

		

		
			
				
				
					<h2>iTunes Match</h2>

					<p>With iTunes Match, all your music can be stored in iCloud — even songs you’ve imported from CDs.4 You can access your music from all your devices and listen to your entire library wherever you are. And when you subscribe to iTunes Match on your Mac, PC, or iOS device, you can also listen to iTunes Radio ad-free. All for just $24.99 per year.</p>

				<h2>iTunes Store.</h2>

				<h2>Where the song in your head becomes the song in your library.</h2>

				<p>The iTunes Store is the best place to get all the music you want — and the music you didn’t know you wanted.5 You’ll find more than 43 million high-quality, DRM-free songs on iTunes for just 69¢, 99¢, or $1.29 each.1 And it’s all just a click away. Listen to a 90-second preview of select songs before you buy.  Complete My Album makes it possible to buy a few songs to try an album out, then get the rest for the original album price minus what you’ve already spent. Buy on any device, and your songs are instantly accessible in your iTunes library.</p>

				
			

		

		
			
				<h2>Discover</h2>

				<p>iTunes has lots of ways to help you find music you’ll love. Top charts. The free Single of the Week. New music recommendations based on your past purchases. Trending Searches to help you narrow down which artist, album, or genre is hot.6 And now Siri works with Shazam, the amazing app that identifies the song that’s playing.3 As soon as you hear a song you like, just ask Siri “What song is this?” to find out the artist, track, album, and more. You can purchase the song immediately from the iTunes Store. Or Siri can add it to your Wish List so you can buy it later.</p>

				
					
						

						
							<h4>Trending Searches</h4>

							<p>Want to know which albums and artists are moving up the charts? Just tap Trending Searches on your iOS device or computer. Trending results are updated throughout the day. So it’s easy to stay on top of who’s at the top.</p>

						
					

					
						

						
							<h4>Shazam in Siri</h4>

							<p>Let’s say you’re in a shop that’s playing music and you want to know the name of the song or who’s singing it. Just hold down the Home button on your iOS device. Tell Siri “Shazam this” and Siri will give you the song title and artist.</p>

						
					
				

			

		

		
			
				<h2>Family Sharing.</h2>

				<h2>Being a family has its perks.</h2>

				<p>Family Sharing makes it easy for up to six people in your family to share each other’s iTunes purchases. Whenever a family member buys a new song or album, everyone else can download and enjoy it. Families can share movies and TV shows, too. And for kids under age 13, or any other family members you choose, you can turn on Ask to Buy, which requires parental permission before purchasing.7</p>

Music purchased on any device is instantly accessible in your iTunes library on your Mac or PC.8 Just tap to play, or even download if you’re going somewhere you won’t have Wi-Fi.
