<a shape="rect" name="section0"></a><h2>Grouping Tracks Into Albums</h2>

<p>
iTunes is a powerful media manager but it has a few organisational quirks, some 
visible directly in the iTunes interface, others that only become apparent when 
you use iTunes to put content on your iPod/iPhone/iPad and yet more which may 
only present problems as your library grows. The aim of this article is to 
briefly explore the different factors that lead to anomalies such as split 
albums and suggest ways to 
organise your media tags so that your library is neatly presented and easy to 
explore. </p>

<p>
<img alt="Eliminate multiple album covers" src="LoveAngelMusicBaby1.png" width="842" height="707"></p>




<a shape="rect" name="section1">Use an album friendly view</a>

In certain views iTunes will let you sort music on different columns, some of 
which are unlikely to group albums together or put the tracks in their normal 
play order. With iTunes 11 when viewing the library in the Songs 
or Playlist views for playback you will generally want to sort 
things on the Album column organized as Album by Artist 
in ascending order. When trying to gather related tracks together having it set 
to Album may sometimes work better. To change which column is 
used for sorting click on the heading of it. For the Album 
column clicking again on the text will cycle through the options Album,
Album by Artist and Album by Artist/Year. Clicking on the 
small black triangle in the active column will reverse the order of the list. 
You'll normally want this pointing upwards. To add or remove columns from the 
list right-click (Win) or command-click (Mac) on the row of headings to see 
options.


<p>
For rapidly scanning through the albums to see which may need attention use the
Songs view, sorted as Album by Artist and 
enable the Column Browser from the View menu. 
Make sure the Albums column is enabled in the browser, select 
the first album, then use the down arrow key to select each album in turn 
looking for albums which need tweaking with one of the techniques below, such as 
albums with more than one artist, or where the tracks are out of sequence.</p>

<p>
You may also want to make use of the search box. In iTunes 11 this has been 
geared towards a tool for selecting tracks to add to the new Up Next feature, or 
to a  playlist, but for organizing your tags the previous filtering 
function is more useful. Enable this by clicking the small magnifying glass and
unticking Search Entire Library. You may also want to 
tick other options there to narrow down a search.</p>

<p>
Once you have focused on an album that is 
causing problems use the Get Info dialog (CTRL+I or CMD+I) to 
edit either individual tracks or select all the tracks of the album and edit 
common properties at the same time. (Note you can use combinations of SHIFT &amp; 
CTRL click to extend a selection.)</p>

<p><a shape="rect" name="section2">One cover, too many tracks</a>

The iPod (and iTunes to a lesser extent) conflates two or more albums with the same title, most obviously with 
Greatest Hits. On the iPod this can result in one album acting as a combination of two or more. Selecting 
any cover gives all the tracks of all albums with the same title. 
See below how selecting either of two distinct albums with the same title gives 
a track listing which is a combination of both albums The workaround for this "Greatest Hits" bug is to give each 
album a unique title - I tend to go for Album - Album Artist as this reads clearly in the iTunes browser. 
Alternatively you could use the wording as it appears on the cover or append different numbers of spaces for each 
different album. Somewhat oddly, setting different values for Sort Album doesn't work.</p>


<a shape="rect" name="section2">

<map id="FPMap0" name="FPMap0"><area shape="rect" coords="541, 5, 748, 359" href="#section1"><area shape="rect" href="#section1" coords="2, 3, 511, 358"></map>
<img alt="Too many tracks" longdesc="Albums with the same name end up sharing tracks on an iPod/iPhone. NB The Sort Album field has been used to put the albums in artist order by editing out the &quot;The &quot; at the start of the artists names." src="section2.png" width="750" height="360" usemap="#FPMap0"></p>

<p>N.b. The images above are for the V3.x 
firmware - iOS 4 actually manages to discriminate between the 
two albums and lists only the tracks of the selected album when using the
Albums menu. However all the tracks will still be returned if you 
access the album via search, including voice. So, until Apple roll out 
a complete fix for the iPhone, similar fixes for older devices, and indeed iTunes itself, the workaround given 
may still present the best approach and will still be needed if an album name has been reused 
by the same artist, e.g. different "Greatest Hits" albums released for a band by different labels.</p>



<p><a shape="rect" name="section3">Missing Artist or Album not with others by same artist</a>

iTunes relies on the Gracenote CDDB database when identifying CD's. This often 
marks collections or anthologies of an artist's work as a compilation. It also seems 
that the iTunes Store may mark an album as a compilation 
in order to keep it grouped when there are tracks with guest or featured 
artists. However, the compilation flag has the logical function of grouping 
together tracks with the same album name, but different artists on each track, 
e.g. "Now That's What I Call Metal 666!". These compilations are then all 
grouped together at the end of cover flow. Most of us would expect "Greatest 
Hits" albums to be listed with the other albums by the same album artist. For 
albums which are essentially by a single album artist or group it is best to set 
the appropriate value for the Album Artist and then set 
Part of a compilation to No.</p>

<p>
<img alt="Get Info - Options" src="Compilation.png" width="410" height="321"></p>

<p>
If, however, you simply want to make sure that you can see all your artists, 
including those who only appear on Compilations then, in iTunes, turn off the 
option to Group compilations in preferences (iTunes 8 &amp; earlier) or turn 
off View &gt; Column Browser &gt; Group Compilations &amp; View &gt; 
Column Browser &gt; Use Album Artists (iTunes 9 &amp; later) and on an iPod Classic turn off 
Settings &gt; Main Menu &gt; Compilations &amp; Settings &gt; Music Menu &gt; 
Compilations.</p>

<p>
N.B. If you have the Use Album Artists feature 
enabled and edit the Album Artist or Sort Album Artist 
values you may find that the artist's position in the list isn't changed until 
you close &amp; reopen iTunes. In addition if you change the Compilation 
status of tracks they may be temporarily treated as tracks from an 
Unknown Album, again things should resolve themselves if you close and 
reopen iTunes.</p>



<p><a shape="rect" name="section4">One album, too many covers</a>

For true compilations, where each track is by a different artist, the answer is to set 
Part of a compilation to Yes and enable the iTunes preference to 
Group compilations when browsing. N.b. since iTunes 9.1 this preference is 
controlled using View &gt; Column Browser &gt; Group Compilations.
If the album is not a compilation 
however, any tracks which list guest artists may be treated as separate items. 
Filling in the Album Artist field is enough to link things in iTunes. Sadly, 
however, most iPod models ignore the Album Artist field when grouping albums so this is only a partial 
solution. You can simply mark the entire album as a compilation which seems to be the way 
iTunes often handles it, however that's not an ideal fix. Short of waiting for Apple to address 
this issue (and as far as I can tell it goes back to the 1st gen. of iPods) we need a workaround. 
What I do is to put any additional artist info. in square brackets after the song name. E.g. 
Track [Feat. Guest] and then set Artist=Album Artist for each track. For anthologies 
where the Album Artist is credited as part of another group, e.g. for Cream tracks on an Eric Clapton anthology, I use 
Track [As Group]. For a track where the main Album Artist doesn't receive a credit, e.g. the 
first track of the Slim Shady LP credited to Jeff Bass, I just set the track name to 
Track [Guest] while still setting the artist to the album artist. N.b. I use square 
brackets to indicate that this is information about the track as distinct from 
parentheses in the song title and also use this style for Mix/Live/Bonus info.



Since firmware version 3.x the iPhone &amp; iPod Touch do in fact use the Album 
Artist field &amp; have stopped grouping on the part of a compilation setting, 
however setting both Part of a compilation to Yes and the 
Album Artist to "Various 
Artists" will group compilation albums both in iTunes and whichever type of 
iPod/iPhone you happen to be using. The artists menu on the iPhone &amp; iPod Touch 
also enumerates all the different values of the Artist field so if you select an 
album where some of the tracks feature guests via the Artists menu then you will 
only get a subset of the tracks from the album. Therefore it may still be best 
to implement the 
Track [Feat. Guest] and Artist=Album Artist workaround to avoid 
some clutter in the Artists menus and make it easier to listen to complete 
albums. N.b. iTunes 9.1 introduced an option under the View &gt; Column 
Browser menu to Use Album Artists which will 
declutter 
the Artist browser pane, however until this change is reflected in all iPod firmware 
the workaround may still provide the best approach.</p>

<p>
From iOS 5 there is an option under Settings &gt; Music 
&gt; Group By Album Artist which finally makes it practical to leave 
guest/feat. artist information in the Artist field, provided you don't plan to 
put your media on older devices which don't support Album Artist.</p>



<p><a shape="rect" name="section5">One album, still too many covers</a>

The Sort Artist, Sort Album &amp; Sort Album Artist fields can be used to override the normal 
sort order. For example iTunes automatically drops leading articles (a/an/the) so "The Beatles" are 
arranged under "B" instead of "T". Occasionally different tracks from the same album can have 
different values in these sort fields which can also break up the grouping. Making the sort 
columns visible in iTunes can help with spotting &amp; correcting such problems.

</p>



<p><a shape="rect" name="section6">Tried that, there are STILL too many covers!</a>

iTunes may split albums into two or more sections if some tracks from the album have different values 
for Artist, Album Artist, Album, Sort Artist, Sort Album Artist, Sort 
Album, No. of Discs or Part of a Compilation. Tiny differences such as 
trailing spaces, accented characters or variants of symbols can sometimes be quite hard to spot. 
The iPod is also more sensitive to case variations and may split, 
duplicate or reorder an album that looks okay in iTunes. Normally overtyping the desired 
value for each shared field will complete the grouping of the album into one entity. Occasionally, 
however, this method seems to fail. When this happens I've found that you can force every field 
to update properly by adding some extra text - e.g. a trailing X, which once applied seems to 
complete the joining of the tracks into one album. Once this has happened the extra data can be 
removed and the album should remain properly grouped.



<a shape="rect" href="merge.asp">A worked example...</a>

</p>



<p><a shape="rect" name="multipletags">Multiple tags</a>

The ID3 specifications allow files to have multiple tags in different 
versions and languages, but iTunes only works properly with single tags. When 
multiple tags are present it can sometimes fail to apply updates to the tag that 
it reads back (presumably updating one of the others in the file) and it is also 
possible that iPod &amp; iTunes may have different rules for which tag they give 
priority to. This could lead to situations in which everything is properly 
organised in iTunes but then inexplicably falls apart on an iPod. There are 3rd party tag editors that can manipulate multiple tags 
but I don't have a recommendation offhand. A workaround in iTunes is to use 
right-click context menu Convert ID3 Tags... &gt; None a few times 
to remove all existing tags and then Convert ID3 Tags... &gt; v2.3 
to build a fresh tag with the information still held in the iTunes database. 
I've read in the past that iTunes isn't fully compliant with the v2.4 spec. 
although this may no longer be the case, however support for v2.3 is widespread 
so I would suggest using v2.3 over v2.4.

</p>



<p><a shape="rect" name="section7">One cover for multi-disc album</a>

Multi-disc albums are often listed as Album (CD1) for CD 1, Album (CD2) for CD 2 
etc. To display these properly using just one cover, each disc should have the correct 
Disc X of Y values set, and then the entire album should be given the single title 
Album. Being somewhat obsessive I also renumber the tracks sequentially, working backwards 
from the last track (so that no two tracks ever have the same number) until I reach disc 1. You can 
still give tracks from the individual discs different artwork should it be relevant so that the 
correct artwork will be displayed as the album progresses.
I've also written a (Windows only) script called
<a shape="rect" href="scripts.asp#AddToTrackNumber">AddToTrackNumber</a> which can help with 
the renumbering aspect. The script
<a shape="rect" href="http://dougscripts.com/itunes/scripts/ss.php?sp=singfromdouble">SingleFromDouble</a> 
should do something similar for Mac users.</p>



<p><a shape="rect" name="section8">Tracks out of sequence</a>

Check that all tracks have the same/correct disc no. For a single disc album this should be 
either blank or 1 of 1. iTunes will sort tracks with a disc no. of 1 before 
those that are blank. Just for fun the iPod sorts them the other way around 
so an album that is correct in iTunes may be out of sequence on an iPod or 
vice-versa. In addition ensure that the Artist, Album Artist, Album, Sort Artist, Sort Album 
Artist &amp; Sort Album fields are consistent across all tracks.</p>



<p><a shape="rect" name="section9">One artist, many names</a>

With some artists, particularly classical composers, you should be aware of alternative 
representations of their names. E.g. 2Pac vs. Tupac. The menus will work best if for each 
artist you standardise on just one form of their name. E.g. make a choice between Mozart, 
W.A. Mozart or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and then apply it consistently. For classical music 
I tend also to use the Composer as the Artist &amp; Album Artist and either discard the 
performer details or place these into the Comments field. 
In some cases the Sort Artist/Sort Album Artist fields can group alternate forms in 
iTunes but these will break up again on the iPod. It is best therefore to use Artist &amp; 
Album Artist consistently so the name is shown the way that you want and Sort Artist &amp; 
Sort Album Artist to control where it is displayed.</p>
