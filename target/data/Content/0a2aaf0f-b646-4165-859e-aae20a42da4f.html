				<h1>General Battery Information</h1>


				
					<p>All battery claims depend on the cellular network, location, signal strength, feature configuration, usage, and many other factors; actual results will vary.

Battery tests are conducted using specific iPhone units. See <a shape="rect" href="/batteries/">www.apple.com/batteries</a> and <a shape="rect" href="/iphone/compare/">www.apple.com/iphone/compare</a> for more information.</p>
