			<dl>	<dt>Can I meet the Business Team without an appointment?</dt>
	<dd>Yes. Every store has a Business Team, and you should be able to meet with a Business Team member each time you visit a store — whether or not you have an appointment.</dd>
	<dt>Can I work with more than one store?</dt>
	<dd>Yes. Your company can take advantage of the Business Team’s services at any Apple Store in the world, whether you’re located in town or traveling. Our Business Team will ensure you have a seamless experience in any Apple Store you visit.</dd>
	<dt>Can I purchase an iPhone business plan from Apple?</dt>
	<dd>In select countries, yes. Business customers in the U.S., UK, Canada,  Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia can purchase and activate business phone plans in our stores.</dd>
	<dt>Will you preload content for volume purchases of iPod, iPad, and Mac?</dt>
	<dd>Yes, we can preload custom content such as photos, videos, audio files, contacts, calendar events, Safari bookmarks, home screen layouts, wallpapers, web clips, and device settings.</dd>
	<dt>What purchasing or financing options are available?</dt>
	<dd>We offer competitive leasing programs and trade-in options, and we can help arrange for a line of credit and special financing. We also accept purchase orders, and we can streamline the purchase and accounting process with an Apple Terms account.</dd>
	<dt>Is Joint Venture for my IT staff or the rest of my employees?</dt>
	<dd>Both. With Joint Venture, we can help IT professionals develop a strategy for supporting employees using Apple products. And all Joint Venture members get assistance with setup, training, and support.</dd>
	<dt>What if I have a new employee join after my other employees have already gone through Joint Venture training?</dt>
	<dd>We'll help your new employees get set up when you purchase new equipment, and our monthly Joint Venture Getting Started workshops make it easy to train one or a few new employees as they join your company.</dd>
	<dt>Can I customize a training session for my employees?</dt>
	<dd>Yes, we can customize your training sessions to cover exactly what your employees need. For example, we can focus on an important feature of Numbers, or we can get your employees started on Mac and iPhone at the same time. Just let us know what you want to cover, and we’ll work with you to make it happen.</dd>
	<dt>Can you help with asset tagging?</dt>
	<dd>Yes. Asset tags are customizable with up to three centered lines of text, and you can specify the starting number. The tag text is black on natural silver, laminated in matte clear tamperproof polyester.</dd>
