			<h4>A faster way for friends to wirelessly connect to your Apple TV.</h4>

			<p>Peer-to-peer AirPlay lets visitors to your home or office quickly and easily connect their Mac or iOS device to your Apple TV without gaining passwords and connecting to the Wi-Fi network. Apple TV detects their device and makes the connection. So they can show off photos, share documents, stream movies, or play music right on your TV. Simple as that.2</p>

		

	



		
			

			
				<h3>AirPlay-enabled speakers. 
Music’s in the house.</h3>


				
					
						<h4>Hear everywhere at once.</h4>

						<p>Say you have one set of speakers in your bedroom, one in the office, and one in the living room. For the ultimate sonic panorama, you can stream your tunes to more than one room simultaneously, so you’ll never lose the beat, no matter where you are in the house. Just choose Multiple Speakers from the AirPlay menu in iTunes. AirPlay works over Wi-Fi, so you can stream music directly from your home network.</p>

					

					
						<h4>See all the details.</h4>

						<p>AirPlay does more than just stream your music to external speakers. It streams information about your music, too. Song titles, artists, album names, elapsed and remaining time, and album artwork all appear on AirPlay-enabled speakers with graphical displays. And AirPlay technology is built into speakers, receivers, and stereo systems from manufacturers like Denon, Marantz, B&amp;W, JBL, and iHome. Simply connect to your home network, and you’ll be streaming tunes throughout your room — or entire house — instantly.</p>

							<h4>Party central with AirPort Express.</h4>

							<p>Have a set of speakers or a receiver without AirPlay? Just connect your components to AirPort Express and you can still stream directly to your home speakers. Your iOS device automatically detects your speakers: Just tap the ones you want to stream to and enjoy your entire iTunes library — every song and every playlist — in any room at any time.</p>
