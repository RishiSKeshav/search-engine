				<h1>iBooks.</h1>

				<h1>Find something good to read. No matter where you are.</h1>

				<p>Be well read with iBooks and all its latest features. It’s included on your iOS device with iOS 8 and on your Mac with OS X Yosemite. So you can fill your iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, or Mac library with everything from the classics to the most recent best sellers. Whether you’re on the go or in for the evening, you’ll always have your favorites within reach.</p>

				
			

		

		
			
				
					<h2>More ways with words.</h2>

					<p>Reading on your iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, or Mac is just like reading a book. But once you get started, you’ll see it’s so much more. Turn pages with a flick on your iOS device or a two-finger swipe on your Mac trackpad. Read one page at a time, or turn your iPad on its side and view two pages at once. Read everything full screen, with no distractions, or read in white-on-black nighttime mode. Alter the look of most books by changing their text size and font. And open as many books as you like when reading on a Mac.</p>

				


				
			

		

		
			
				

				
					<h2>With Series, your library gets a little more organized.</h2>

					<p>View your books by title, author, category, or series.
Or browse your entire library in All Books. If you have multiple books in a series, iBooks groups them together. Tap the series and it expands. You can see which books you already own and which ones are available next in the series. When you’re ready for the next book, you can purchase it right from your library.1</p>

				

			

		

		
			
				
					<h2>iBooks and iCloud.</h2>

					<p>iCloud stores the stuff you care about — your music, photos, and contacts, for example — and makes it accessible from your iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, or Mac.2 iCloud even stores your books. And it doesn’t matter which device you use to buy them, because you’ll see every title you’ve purchased in your library. If you want it on your device, just tap to download it. So you can read one of your favorites on your iPhone during your morning commute, page through a few chapters of that same book on your Mac later in the day, and pick up right where you left off on your iPad at bedtime.</p>

					<a shape="rect" href="/icloud/">Learn more about iCloud</a>
				


				
			

		

		
			
				<h2>Auto-night theme.</h2>

				<p>If you’re reading in low light on your iPad or iPhone, iBooks for iOS automatically switches to white-on-black text on your screen. When the light improves, iBooks automatically switches back.3</p>

				
			

		

		
			
				
					<h2>All the highlights. And the notes. And the de?nitions.</h2>

					<p>Use your finger as a highlighter when you’re reading a book on your iOS device or Mac. Just swipe over the selected text (using the trackpad on your Mac), and it’s highlighted. Tap a highlighted section and a palette appears. Change colors, switch to underline, or add a note instantly. Then switch to the Notes view to see all your notes and highlights instantly organized in one place, making it a cinch to search or go back to the highlighted sections of your book. When you take notes or highlight passages, iCloud pushes them to all your devices automatically. And it remembers which page you’re on, so you can pick up right where you left off.2</p>

				


				
			

		

		
			
				<h2>Share quotes on Facebook or Twitter.</h2>

				<p>Maybe you’re reading a hilarious take on family that’s spot on about yours. Or you come across a fact that supports the premise of your thesis. All you know is, you have to share it. With iBooks, you can share the perfect phrase directly from the page on Facebook or Twitter. You can also send a snippet via text or email.</p>

				
			

		

		
			
				
					<h2>Put PDFs in your library.</h2>

					<p>In addition to keeping all your books in one place, iBooks keeps track of your PDF files, too. User guides, business proposals, project plans — put them all in your iBooks library for easy access. When someone emails you a PDF, you can save it to iBooks. Then go to your library and tap to open it.</p>

				


				
			

		

		
			
				<h2>Multi?Touch books for iPad and Mac.</h2>

				<p>Experience the most amazing books you’ve ever read. These books take advantage of everything you can do on your iPad or Mac. They’re capable of Multi?Touch, audio, video, and more. With Multi-Touch books, you’re no longer limited to flat images on paper. Flick or swipe through a photo gallery. Use a finger to rotate a 3D object. Watch animations spring to life. Or listen to audio commentary. You can find Multi?Touch books — including iBooks Textbooks — in the iBooks Store. Browse categories like Food and Cooking, Arts and Entertainment, Travel, and more. Each title is like nothing you’ve ever experienced. And it’s something you won’t want to put down.</p>

					<h2>Out with the old edition. In with the new.</h2>

					<p>Books — especially textbooks — get updated for any number of reasons. Thankfully, the iBooks app supports book updates. That means if a book you purchased is republished with new or additional content, iBooks lets you know. You can download the updated version free, and it automatically replaces the older copy in your library.</p>
